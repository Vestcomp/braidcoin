Experiments in a improving Bitcoin using a Directed Acyclic Graph

Running these examples requires [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and the ipython
kernel.  Fire up the example notebook in your browser by `jupyter notebook`.

We use [graph_tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/) for plotting.  This one is a
bitch to compile, I recommend getting it from your friendly local pre-compiled
distribution.  I use Ubuntu 16.04.  The dependencies for running my notebook are
pre-compiled there, just:

  sudo apt-get install ipython3-notebook python3-graph-tool python3-joblib python3-scipy
